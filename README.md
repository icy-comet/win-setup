> A Windows setup script I maintain for a local client.

Feel free to customize and use it yourself.

# How to use?
- Edit the `setup_prefs.txt` template and mention all the function serials (from the tables below) to execute and undo on lines 7 and 11 respectively separated with a comma. Mention the action to take on line 3 -- `Undo` or `Setup`
- Edit `setup_apps.txt` to include winget IDs of the apps to be installed.
- Run `winget search <app-name>` to get the winget ID.
- You can also find the script's log file on your Desktop.

# Run
Open Powershell As Admin and enter:
```
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JXEh5'))
```
